# FinalProject165

Title: 
Public vs Private Healthcare

Purpose: 
With an ongoing debate about weather healthcare should be controlled privately or by a public sector in the United States, my main goal for this project is to visually represent both sides of the debate. It is extreamly common in this day and age that people only see the side they want to see, yet with this visualzation both sides will be equally represented. This will be a helpful tool to facitile the debate by providing one to one comparisons with the same metrics. I hope to not only educate people about this ongoing debate but also provide some important statistics that could help to facilite a positive change. 


Data Sources: 
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3378609/ : this article has 6 evaluation catagories to discuss this debate (Access and responsiveness; Quality; Outcomes; Accountability, transparency, and regulation; Fairness and equity; Efficancy)

http://www.who.int/healthsystems/topics/financing/healthreport/P-P_HSUNo39.pdf : Points out the differences in technical definitions vs social definitions. This will be important for representing "efficiancy" properly. 

https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/1777/economics/health-care-arguments/ : to point out the main arguments on each side in order to visually express data related to these key points


Visulazations:
https://data.oecd.org/healthres/health-spending.htm : Simple data visulation of comparing different aspects of healthcare in different contries 

https://sureshlodha.github.io/CMPS165_Fall2016_FinalProjects/BRICS_HDIGDP/ : Most similar project concept that has been previously done. I plan to do less of a chart over time and one that covers the different points in the arguments.
